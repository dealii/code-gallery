# Introduction
In this tutorial, the studied problem is to simulate temperature distributions of a sample under a moving laser. Light penetrates the substrate without loss. The top-covered thin-film is, however, a light absorbing material. For simplicity, the thin-film is assumed to be TiO$_2$ mixed with silver nanoparticles, which supports light heating of the material by absorbing light energy. For this tutorial, we only consider the isotropic absorption. The Figure below illustrates the sketch of the problem. The absorption coefficient is assumed to be $10^4 m^{-1}$. The substrate is glass. The thickness of the thin-film is assumed to be 400 nm. The spot size at the top of thin film is $20 \mu m$ at $e^{-2}$. The writing speed is assumed to be 10 mm/s. The laser power is 0.4 W. The time step is set as 10 $\mu s$. The initial position of laser center is $-50 \mu m$ with 50 $\mu m$ distance away from the left boundary to avoid boundary effects.

# Discretization of the non-uniform isotropic heat equation
In general, the non-uniform isotropic heat equation is as following
@f{align*}
    \rho C_m \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} -\nabla \cdot (k\nabla T) = f(\textbf{x})
@f}

Now, we discretize the equation in time with the theta-scheme  as
@f{align*}
    \rho C_m \frac{T^{n} - T^{n-1}}{dt} - [(1-\theta) \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T^{n-1}) + \theta \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T^n)] = (1-\theta) f^{n-1}(\textbf{x}) + \theta f^n(\textbf{x})
@f}

where $\theta$ is a parameter; if $\theta = 0 (\text{or} = 1)$, it becomes forward (backward) explicit Euler method; the Crank-Nicolson method is when $\theta = 0.5$. Integrating by the test function $T^{'}$ and do integration by parts

@f{align*}
    \int T^{'} \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) dV = T^{'} k \nabla T |^a_b - \int k \nabla T \cdot \nabla T^{'} dV
@f}

since the test function is time invariant (because the grid is not changed), we have $T^{'n}$ = $T^{'n-1}$.

@f{align*}
    T &= \sum{_i} {u_i} T^{'}_{i} \\
    \int T T^{'}_{i} dV &= u_{i}
@f}

Let 
@f{align*}
    M &= \int \rho C_m T^{'_i} T^{'_j} dV  \\
    A & = \int k \nabla T^{'_i} \cdot \nabla T^{'_j} dV \\
    F^n & = \int T' f^{n}(\textbf{x})
@f}

we have the following term,

@f{align*}
    \int T^{'} \rho C_m [T^{n} - T^{n-1}] - dt \int T^{'} [(1-\theta) \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T^{n-1}) + \theta \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T^n)] \\ = dt \int T^{'} (1-\theta) f^{n-1}(\textbf{x}) + dt \int T^{'} \theta f^n(\textbf{x})
@f}

@f{align*}
    M U^n - M U^{n-1} - dt \int T^{'} [(1-\theta) \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T^{n-1}) + \theta \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T^n)] \\ = dt \int T^{'} (1-\theta) f^{n-1}(\textbf{x}) + dt \int T^{'} \theta f^n(\textbf{x})
@f}

@f{align*}
    M U^n - M U^{n-1} + dt [(1-\theta) A U^{n-1} + \theta A U^n] \\ = dt (1-\theta) F^{n-1} + dt \theta F^{n}
@f}

the final equation becomes

@f{align*}
    (M + dt \theta A) U^n = [M - dt (1-\theta) A] U^{n-1} + dt (1-\theta) F^{n-1} + dt \theta F^{n}
@f}

# Initial temperature
The initial temperature can be interpolated over each vertex as follows,
@f{align*}
    M_0 &= \int T^{'_i} T^{'_j} dV  \\
    T_0 &= \sum_i u_i T^{'i}  = g_0(x) \\
    M_0 U &= \int g_0(\textbf{x}) T^{'i} dV
@f}

which is robust for general use. In fact, Deal.II provides a function (VectorTools::interpolate) doing the same thing, which is, however, may not necessary work for parallel version.

## Results
