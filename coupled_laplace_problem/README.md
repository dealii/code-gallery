Laplace equation coupled to an external simulation program
------------------------------------------
## Overview

preCICE allows to couple deal.II to external simulation software, such as OpenFOAM, SU2, or CalculiX. To keep dependencies of this example minimal, we couple deal.II to an external C++ program, which provides a time varying boundary condition. The deal.II code consists mainly of the step-4 tutorial program, where a simple Laplace problem is solved.

Coupling with preCICE is usually carried out along surfaces in order to apply a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling between two domains (volume coupling is also possible). For the sake of simplicity, we couple here an external C++ program in a unidirectional fashion to one side of our quadrilateral domain. The external C++ program generates a parabolic boundary profile with time varying amplitude. The boundary values are then used in the Laplace solver as a Dirichlet boundary condition.

## Time discretization
Coupled simulations deal mostly with time-dependent problems. Hence, we make the stationary Laplace problem from step-4 time dependent.
@f{align*}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\Delta u &= f \qquad\qquad & \text{in}\ \Omega,
  \\
  u &= x^2+y^2 \qquad\qquad & \text{on}\ \partial\Omega_s,
  \\
  u &= g(t) \qquad\qquad & \text{on}\ \partial\Omega_c.
@f}
with the fixed Dirichlet boundary $\Omega_s$, the coupling boundary $\Omega_c$ and the time-dependent coupling data $g(t)$.

The system is consequently discretized by a first-order backward Euler method, resulting in
@f{align*}
  \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}-\Delta u^{n+1} &= f \qquad\qquad & \text{in}\ \Omega,
@f}
at the next time level n+1.

## Requirements

* `deal.II`, version `9.2` or greater. Older versions might work as well, but have not been tested.

* [preCICE](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki#1-get-precice), version `2.0` or greater. Have a look at the provided link for an installation guide.

## Compiling and running

Similar to the example programs, run
```
cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.II -Dprecice_DIR=/path/to/precice .
```
in this directory to configure the problem. The explicit specification of the library locations can be omitted if they are installed globally or via environment variables.
You can then switch between debug and release mode by calling either
```
make debug
```
or
```
make release
```
This command will generate two executables: one for the `coupled_laplace_problem` and one for the `fancy_boundary_condition` participant.
```
./coupled_laplace_problem
```
executes the `coupled_laplace_problem`. In order to start the coupled simulation, execute
```
./fancy_boundary_condition
```
in the same directory from another terminal window.

preCICE and the deal.II solver create several log files during the simulation. In order to remove all result-associated files and clean-up the simulation directory the Allclean script can be executed.

## Results

By default, the results are saved in each time step using `vtk` files, which can, for example, be visualized with ParaView. You should get something like:

In the [preCICE tutorials](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/tree/master/FSI/flap_perp_2D/OpenFOAM-deal.II), a fluid-structure interaction example is given coupling OpenFOAM (fluid dynamics) to deal.II (solid mechanics).
